# Summary

`pathways` is a Python package that characterizes the environmental impacts of products, sectors or transition scenarios
over time using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Compared to traditional scenario results from energy models, `pathways`
provides a more detailed and transparent view of the environmental impacts of a scenario by resolving supply chains 
between producers and consumers (as an LCA does). Hence, direct and indirect emissions are accounted for, and 
double-counting issues are partially resolved.

`pathways` is initially designed to work with data packages produced by `premise` [@Sacchi:2022], but can be used with any Integrated
Assessment Model (IAM) scenarios  and LCA databases. It reads a scenario and a corresponding set of scenario-based LCA matrices and calculates the 
environmental impacts of the scenario (or a subset of it) over time.

# Statement of need

IAMs, frequently based on Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), offer cost-optimized projections of future scenarios, 
highlighting, for example, the necessary changes in regional electricity mixes and different means of transport to meet
global warming objectives [@Riahi:2017]. This scenario analysis exercise enables us to predict future system changes 
and their effects on the environmental performance of different technologies along the different supply chains. In this context,
prospective Life Cycle Assessment (pLCA) emerges as a unique tool to provide a robust evaluation of the environmental 
performance of both existing and anticipated production systems. At the methodological level, [@Sacchi:2022] has recently 
laid the foundations for extending present-day process-based life cycle inventories into the future using the output 
from IAMs. Meanwhile, most efforts in pLCA have been centred around improving the ability to forecast future life cycle
inventories accurately.

At this juncture, performing an LCA of the transition scenarios using the updated life cycle inventories at each time step
uncaps excellent potential to improve the sustainability assessment of these scenarios. LCA would expand the 
conventional focus on GHG emissions to broader environmental impacts, such as land use, water consumption, and toxicity while considering direct 
and indirect emissions. However, running LCAs of the transition scenarios provided by IAMs -or energy system models - at
the system level remains challenging. This is primarily due to the computational expense of running LCAs for each region at
each timestep for each scenario and the methodological complexity of consistently defining the functional unit of the LCA
based on the IAMs outputs while dealing with issues such as double-counting. `pathways`, using the LCA 
framework `brightway2` [@Mutel:2017] and building on `premise`, offers a solution to these challenges by providing a 
tool to evaluate the environmental impacts  of transition scenarios systematically.

# Description

LCA is based on input-output matrices that represent exchanges of products and services along with their associated environmental interventions.
`pathways` uses these matrices, as exported by `premise` after the modification of Ecoinvent [@Wernet:2016] based on the output from the IAM or custom scenarios,
to calculate the environmental impacts of a transition scenario over time. The functional unit of the LCA is defined based on the IAM. Figure 1 illustrates the workflow of the `pathways` package.

LCA is underpinned by input-output matrices that detail the exchanges of products and services 
along with their associated environmental interventions. `pathways` utilizes the matrices generated by `premise`, which
modifies the Ecoinvent database [@Wernet:2016] based on outputs from IAMs or custom scenarios. 
This setup enables `pathways` to systematically calculate the environmental impacts of transition scenarios over time. 
The functional unit of each LCA is defined in accordance with the outputs from the IAM. Figure 1 illustrates the 
workflow of the `pathways` package.

# Usage

`pathways` is a Python package and can be used in Python scripts or in a Python interpreter. To use the Pathways class,
a datapackage containing the scenario data, mapping information, and LCA matrices must be provided.
The datapackage should be a zip file that contains the following files:

- `datapackage.json`: a JSON file that describes the contents of the datapackage.
- a `mapping` folder containing a `mapping.yaml` file that describes the mapping between the IAM scenario and the LCA databases.
- a `inventories` folder containing the LCA matrices as CSV files.
- a `scenario` folder containining the IAM scenario data as CSV files.

# Impact

//// DRAFT ////

By systematically updating and integrating LCA matrices over time, `pathways` improves the accuracy and relevance of 
environmental impact assessments for transition scenarios. This tool fosters greater alignment between LCAs and IAM 
outputs, enhancing the consistency and reliability of environmental assessments across different modeling platforms.

Additionally, `pathways` offers a detailed and structured workflow that enables IAM 
modellers to incorporate LCA into their analyses. This opens new avenues for these modellers to enhance the 
environmental dimension of their work.

Designed to be both reproducible and transparent, `pathways` facilitates collaboration and verification within the 
scientific community. This approach ensures that improvements in environmental impact assessments are accessible and 
beneficial to a broader range of stakeholders.


# Conclusion

`pathways` provides a tool to systematically evaluate the environmental impacts of transition scenarios, covering the entire 
supply chain of products and services along a wide range of environmental impact categories. This tool incorporates the results of each scenario into the LCA database at every 
timestep, ensuring that the assessments are continuously updated for each timestep and reflect changes as they occur.
