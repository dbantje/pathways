# Summary

`pathways` is a Python package that characterizes the environmental impacts of products, sectors or transition scenarios
over time using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Compared to traditional scenario results from energy models, `pathways`
provides a more detailed and transparent view of the environmental impacts of a scenario by resolving supply chains 
between producers and consumers (as an LCA does). Hence, direct and indirect emissions are accounted for, and 
double-counting issues are partially resolved.

`pathways` is initially designed to work with data packages produced by premise, but can be used with any IAM scenarios 
and LCA databases. It reads a scenario and a corresponding set of scenario-based LCA matrices and calculates the 
environmental impacts of the scenario (or a subset of it) over time.
